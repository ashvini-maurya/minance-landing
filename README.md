# Minance

Landing page for the webapplication. The live webapp is at: [GitHub Pages](https://ashvinikumar.github.io/minance-landing/). 

Here are the steps which I followed during the development.

  - HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for normal page development
  - Bootstrap and media query used to make page responsive.
  - To make page responsive I used CSS to manage background images. The other approach could have been used is that to use different background images (different image for different screen size).
